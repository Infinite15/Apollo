# Apollo Client

This package is heavily in development. We plan on releasing an alpha build mid-April, but we wouldn't recommend using it until then unless you really know what you're doing. Until then, check out the docs and the source code to see what we're cooking.

## Installing

Install from NPM:

```
npm install apollo-client
```

To use this client in a web browser or mobile app, you'll need a build system capable of loading NPM packages on the client. Some common choices include Browserify, Webpack, and Meteor 1.3. Move on to the next article to see how to import and initialize the client.
