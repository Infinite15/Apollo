# Redux integration

By default, the Apollo Client creates its own internal Redux store to manage queries and their results. If you are already using Redux for the rest of your app, you can have the client integrate with your existing store instead. This will let you better track the different events that happen in your app, and how your client and server side data changes interleave.
