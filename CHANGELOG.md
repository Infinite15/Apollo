# Change log

Expect active development and potentially significant breaking changes in the `0.x` track. We'll try to be diligent about releasing a `1.0` version in a timely fashion (ideally within 1 or 2 months), so that we can take advantage of SemVer to signify breaking changes from that point on.

### vNEXT

- Add everything that isn't a compiled file to `npmignore`. [PR #165](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/pull/165)

### v0.2.0

- Add polling functionality to `watchQuery`. [Issue #145](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/issues/145) [PR #153](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client/pull/153)

### v0.1.0

Initial release, not out yet.

We didn't track changes before this version.
