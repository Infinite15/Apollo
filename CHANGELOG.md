# Change log

Expect active development and potentially significant breaking changes in the `0.x` track. We'll try to be diligent about releasing a `1.0` version in a timely fashion (ideally within 1 or 2 months), so that we can take advantage of SemVer to signify breaking changes from that point on.

### v0.1.0

Initial release, not out yet.

We didn't track changes before this version.
